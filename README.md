# pypilot_conversion
Details of converting a ST1000/ST2000 tiller pilot into a PyPilot implementation.

## Converting your own. 

#### getting the boards 
most if not any PCB(Printed circuit board) manifacturer works with gerber files, the pypilot_conversion is made of 3 PBC:
 - pypilot_motor
 - pypilot_keyboard
 - pypilot_dome

#### getting the parts
Each board also have a part list of electronics components you will need to solder on the boards. Commonly named BOM(bills of material)

####  Building
Build notes:

- Had to flip one resistor on the keyboard to the front; otherwise it was in the way of a piece of the plastic casing. Also had to tilt the buckdown converter to its side.
- The motor board has one fault on it: the A3 input had to be tied to +5V, otherwise the controller thinks the motor is 170Â°C and would not move. Solved by cutting the pin 22 off the arduino and putting a resistor between arduino pins 22 and 27.
- The current measuring is still a bit in progress. The Pololu CS (current sense) pin is supposed to give 'about 20 mV/A plus a 50 mV offset', but setting the servo.current.factor and .offset was not enough; I tweaked motor.ino a bit but don't get a linear reading so far.

####  Software
To be used in combination with pypilot_ray replacing pypilot_hat.

## Developpement

Work in progress; details follow in due time. Based on a prototype described here https://forum.openmarine.net/showthread.php?tid=1864&pid=9664#pid9664
